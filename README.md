1. Initial Composition in MuseScore:  
   We began by crafting the initial composition using MuseScore, a music notation software. This allowed us to sketch out the main musical themes, harmonies, and structure of the piece, providing a clear foundation for the rest of the process.

2. Replicating the Composition in OpenMusic:  
   Once the core musical ideas were established, we transitioned to OpenMusic to replicate the composition algorithmically. Using the graphical interface, we created various sequences of musical notes, each representing different melodic lines, harmonies, and rhythmic patterns. OpenMusic's flexibility enabled us to experiment with algorithmic variations, exploring ways to enhance the composition dynamically.

3. Harmonization and Chord Structures:  
   After defining the note sequences, we linked them to their corresponding chord progressions. This involved precise control over harmonic structures and voicings, ensuring that the musical phrases were both cohesive and aligned with the intended emotional tone of the soundtrack.

4. Finalizing the Composition:  
   Once the individual musical elements were in place, we assembled them into a complete composition. We adjusted timing, transitions, and dynamics to achieve a seamless flow, while ensuring the piece maintained the atmosphere and tension suitable for a game like Assassin’s Creed Unity
